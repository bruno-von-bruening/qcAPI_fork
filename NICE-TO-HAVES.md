# File storage managment
* Upon download: make some kind of file that describes the sourcing of the file
* Upon storage: ommit/deleete files that where source from database (e.g. when a surface was loaded and dumped from database)
-> is this a good idea in the first place (likely a balance depedning on storage vs reproducability tradeoff)
